events:
  - name: ON_PM_QUERY_START
    at_hour: 0 #12pm in day 1's noon
    description: Analysts start to work in Day 1's afternoon. Raven will randomly issue queries to engine in the following N hours,
      where N = time(ON_PM_QUERY_FINISH) - time(ON_PM_QUERY_START). Statistically the frequency of queries may exhibit a distribution like Guass distribution.
  - name: ON_PM_QUERY_FINISH
    at_hour: 6 #6pm in day 1's afternoon
    description: Analysts get off work for Day 1. No more queries will arrive until next morning. Raven asynchronously invokes engine's ON_PM_QUERY_FINISH callback to allow engine to release
      resource(if possible) in the coming night
  - name: ON_ETL_START
    at_hour: 12 #0am in the morning
    description: Day 2's ETL starts
  - name: ON_ETL_FINISH_30_MINUTES_COUNTDOWN
    description: Raven asynchronously notifies engine that ETL job will finish in 30 minutes
    ## at_hour of this event is automatically calculated as: time(ON_ETL_FINISH) - 1/2
    # CAUTION: It's not allowed define another "ON_ETL_FINISH_XX_MINUTES_COUNTDOWN", unless you can prove the extra time your engine needs is unproportional to the size of historical data size
  - name: ON_ETL_FINISH
    at_hour: 18 #6am in the morning
    description: Day 2's ETL has finished, new queryable data are loaded in S3 bucket. Raven asynchronously invokes engine's ON_ETL_FINISH callback to allow engine get prepared for
      the queries to come. Typical prepare jobs may include lauching cluster, ingesting data, building index, etc. engine should garantee all the jobs finish in N hours,
      where N = time(ON_AM_QUERY_START) - time(ON_ETL_FINISH).
  - name: ON_QUERY_START_30_MINUTES_COUNTDOWN
    description: Raven asynchronously notifies engine that the queries will come in 30 minutes.
    ## at_hour of this event is automatically calculated as: time(ON_AM_QUERY_START) - 1/2
    # CAUTION: It's not allowed define another "ON_QUERY_START_XX_MINUTES_COUNTDOWN", unless you can prove the extra time your engine needs is unproportional to the size of historical data size
  - name: ON_AM_QUERY_START
    at_hour: 20 #8am in the morning
    description: Analysts start to work in Day 2's morning. After asynchronously invoking engine's ON_AM_QUERY_START callback, Raven will randomly issue queries to engine in the following N hours,
      where N = time(ON_AM_QUERY_FINISH) - time(ON_AM_QUERY_START). Statistically the frequency of queries may exhibit a distribution like Guass distribution.
  - name: ON_AM_QUERY_FINISH
    at_hour: 24 #12pm in the noon
    description: Analysts go for lunch for Day 2. This remarks the end of our benchmarkig period.
