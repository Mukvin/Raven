This document is for those who want to re-generate TPCH-100 query workload.

Most common users don't need to read this article.

## How are the TPCH tables generated?

1. create a EMR cluster in AWS
2. follow https://github.com/hortonworks/hive-testbench to generate data on EMR
3. copy the table data in EMR HDFS to S3

## How are the workload queries generated?

### Duplicate Mode (default)

In workloads/tpch_100/tool/adjusted_tpch we have prepared 22 tpch queries. By iterating these 22 queries over and over
again, we can generate a huge set of queries (say 20000 queries)
Check out workloads/tpch_100/tool/generate_query_script_duplicate_mode.py for details if you need to customize the
workload.

### Non-Duplicate Mode

``Non duplicate mode is complete now, as we can't garantee each query generated by qgen can be DIRECTLY recognized by each engine``

For TPCH query generation we use https://github.com/gregrahn/tpch-kit/ , follow its instructions to learn how to use it.

We can further use the following code snippet to generate thousands of TPCH queries:

```bash
for ((i=1;i<=1000;i++)); do
        for ((j=1;j<=22;j++)); do
                ./qgen -v -c -s 100 ${j} > scale100_queries_sample/tpch-query-${j}-${i}.sql
                sleep 1 # otherwise consecutive queries will be identical
        done
done
```

This code snippet may take a few hours to finish.

What the above code does is to generate random queries from 22 TPCH query templates for 1000 times. Now we get 1000*22 =
22000 distinct (almost) queries, use following command to check how many queries are duplicated:

```
find . -type f -exec sed -i  ".bak"  '/^--/d' {} \; # delete comment lines start with "--"

# find . -type f -name "*.sql" |  xargs md5 -q | sort | uniq | wc -l
# on my MAC this command return 7377, which means (22000 - 7377) queries are duplicate

for ((j=1;j<=22;j++)); do
	print "count dedup queries (from 1000 queries) for query template ${j}:"
    find . -type f -name "tpch-query-${j}-*.sql" |  xargs md5 -q | sort | uniq | wc -l
done
```

after 22000 queries ready, we can use the script
in `workloads/tpch_100/tool/generate_query_script_non_duplicate_mode.py`  to generate the `query script`for our
workload.
