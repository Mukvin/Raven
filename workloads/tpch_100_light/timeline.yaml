  - name: ON_PM_QUERY_START
    at_hour: 0 #1pm in day 1
    description: Analysts start to work in Day 1's afternoon. Raven will randomly issue queries to engine in the following N hours,
      where N = time(ON_PM_QUERY_FINISH) - time(ON_PM_QUERY_START). Statistically the frequency of queries may exhibit a distribution like Guass distribution.
  - name: ON_PM_QUERY_FINISH
    at_hour: 1 #6pm in day 1's afternoon
    description: Analysts get off work for Day 1. No more queries will arrive until next morning. Raven asynchronously invokes engine's ON_PM_QUERY_FINISH callback to allow engine to release
      resource(if possible) in the coming night

    at_hour: 2 #0am in the morning
    description: Day 2's ETL starts
#  - name: ON_ETL_FINISH_30_MINUTES_COUNTDOWN
#    at_hour: 16.5
#    description: Raven asynchronously notifies engine that ETL job will finish in 30 minutes
  - name: ON_ETL_FINISH
    at_hour: 3 #6am in the morning
    description: Day 2's ETL has finished, new queryable data are loaded in S3 bucket. Raven asynchronously invokes engine's ON_ETL_FINISH callback to allow engine get prepared for
      the queries to come. Typical prepare jobs may include lauching cluster, ingesting data, building index, etc. engine should garantee all the jobs finish in N hours,
      where N = time(ON_AM_QUERY_START) - time(ON_ETL_FINISH).

#    description: Raven asynchronously notifies engine that the queries will come in 30 minutes.
  - name: ON_AM_QUERY_START
    at_hour: 4 #8am in the morning
    description: Analysts start to work in Day 2's morning. After asynchronously invoking engine's ON_AM_QUERY_START callback, Raven will randomly issue queries to engine in the following N hours,
      where N = time(ON_AM_QUERY_FINISH) - time(ON_AM_QUERY_START). Statistically the frequency of queries may exhibit a distribution like Guass distribution.

    at_hour: 5 #1pm in day 2
    description: Analysts go for lunch for Day 2. This remarks the end of our benchmarkig period.
